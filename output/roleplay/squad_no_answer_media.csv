This rebound is still occurring in regions like Scandinavia, causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe."

Why were numeric codes converted to graphic codes?,"Numeric codes were converted to graphic codes in order to facilitate the identification and sorting of characters within the code. By separating control characters from graphic characters and arranging them in a specific pattern, it became easier to distinguish between different types of characters. Additionally, the decision to support uppercase 64-character alphabets led to the arrangement of ASCII in a way that allowed for easy reduction to a usable 64-character set of graphic codes. This organization also allowed for the possibility of including lowercase letters and other graphics in the future. The arrangement of digits 0-9 in a way that corresponded to binary values also made conversion with binary-coded decimal straightforward."

What exist for a second in a lab?,"In a lab, some subatomic particles exist for only a fixed fraction of a second when relatively at rest. However, particles that travel close to the speed of light, such as muons, can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected. This phenomenon is explained by the special theory of relativity, where in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero because its velocity is zero. This concept demonstrates how time and space can be altered by high-speed motion, as shown by Einstein in his thought experiments."
