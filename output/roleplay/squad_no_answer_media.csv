The phenomenon of post-glacial rebound, where land that was previously depressed by the weight of ice sheets begins to rise, also contributed to the rise in sea levels. This rebound is still occurring in regions like Scandinavia, causing weak earthquakes across Northern Europe."

What exist for a second in a lab?,"In a lab, some subatomic particles exist for only a fixed fraction of a second when relatively at rest. However, particles that travel close to the speed of light, such as muons, can be measured to travel farther and survive much longer than expected. This phenomenon is explained by the special theory of relativity, where in the high-speed particle's frame of reference, it exists for a standard amount of time known as its mean lifetime, and the distance it travels in that time is zero because its velocity is zero. This concept demonstrates how time and space can be altered by high-speed motion, as shown by Einstein in his thought experiments."
